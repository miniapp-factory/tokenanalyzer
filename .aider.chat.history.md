```
Name: Small Token Analyzer
Purpose: Fast analysis of new, small-cap, or lesser-known tokens.
Deployment Description:
This mini app generates a structured token analysis based on publicly available information. The user enters a token name or ticker, and the bot returns a detailed breakdown: utility, tokenomics, unlock schedule, risks, competition, triggers for growth, and a risk warning.
No APIs required — the app acts as an intelligent analytical template.
Core Features:
At least 8 analytical categories: Utility, Tokenomics, Unlocks, Competitors, Risks, Stage, Potential, Risk Score
Checks exchange presence (based on known market data patterns, no API)
Provides a final rating (“high / medium / low risk”)
Supports user questions about the project
Deployment Instructions:
Deploy as an analytical mini-app with the main instruction:
“When the user enters a token or project name, return a structured analysis in the format: Overview → Token Utility → Tokenomics → Unlocks → Roadmap → Risks → Opportunities → Final Score.”
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

The changes you need to make are in two files that are not yet in the chat:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create this file to generate the app logo.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
