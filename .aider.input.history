+Code the following app
+```
+Name: Small Token Analyzer
+Purpose: Fast analysis of new, small-cap, or lesser-known tokens.
+Deployment Description:
+This mini app generates a structured token analysis based on publicly available information. The user enters a token name or ticker, and the bot returns a detailed breakdown: utility, tokenomics, unlock schedule, risks, competition, triggers for growth, and a risk warning.
+No APIs required — the app acts as an intelligent analytical template.
+Core Features:
+At least 8 analytical categories: Utility, Tokenomics, Unlocks, Competitors, Risks, Stage, Potential, Risk Score
+Checks exchange presence (based on known market data patterns, no API)
+Provides a final rating (“high / medium / low risk”)
+Supports user questions about the project
+Deployment Instructions:
+Deploy as an analytical mini-app with the main instruction:
+“When the user enters a token or project name, return a structured analysis in the format: Overview → Token Utility → Tokenomics → Unlocks → Roadmap → Risks → Opportunities → Final Score.”
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
